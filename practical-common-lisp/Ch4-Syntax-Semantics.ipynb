    "### Language Processor.\n",
    "- Has two parts to it:\n",
    "     - The *reader* - defines how strings can be translated to Lisp objects called *s-expressions*.\n",
    "     - The *evaluator* - defines a syntax of Lisp *forms* that can be built out of s-expressions.\n",
    "     \n",
    "### S-expressions\n",
    "- Basic elements are *lists* and *atoms*. \n",
    "- Lists are delimited by parentheses and contain any number of whitespace-separated elements. The elements are s-expressions (atoms or nested lists).\n",
    "- Atoms are everything else (everything else that's not a list or a comment)\n",
    "- Names used in Lisp such as **FORMAT** OR **\\*db\\*** are represented by objects called *symbols*.\n",
    "- After the *reader* has read in a name and converted it to uppercase, it ***interns*** it -- looks it up a table called *package* and if it can't find one, creates a new symbol and adds it to the table. Otherwise, it returns the symbol already in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You combine numbers, string and symbols with lists to build s-expressions representing arbitrary trees of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```lisp\n",
    "x             ; symbol x\n",
    "()            ; empty list\n",
    "(1 2 3)       ; list of 3 numbers\n",
    "(+ (* 2 3) 4) ; a list of a symbol, a list and a number\n",
    "\n",
    ";; A Lisp function structure:: A list of two symbols,\n",
    ";; the empty list and another list, in this case containing\n",
    ";; two symbols and a string.\n",
    "(defun hello-world ()\n",
    "    (format t \"Hello, world!\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### S-expressions as Lisp forms\n",
    "- Any atom (nonlist or the empty list) is a legal Lisp form as is any list that has a symbol as its first element.\n",
    "- The simplest Lisp forms, atoms, can be divided into symbols and everything else.\n",
    "- A symbol, evaluated as a form, is considered the name of a variable and it evaluates to the current value of that variable.\n",
    "- All other atoms (non-symbols, e.g numbers, strings) are *self-evaluating* objects.\n",
    "- Other self-evaluating symbols are *keyword* symbols -- symbols whose names start with a **:**. When the reader interns such a name, it automatically defines a constant variable with the name and with the symbol as the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How lists are evaluated.\n",
    "- To determine what kind of form a given list is, the evaluator determines whether the symbol that starts the list is either the name of a function, a special operator or a macro. If the symbol isn't defined yet, it's assumed to be a function name. These forms can be referred to as **function call forms**, **macro forms** and **special forms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function Calls\n",
    "- Function evaluation rule: *evaluate the remaining elements of the list as Lisp forms and pass the resulting values to the named function*.\n",
    "- The remaining elements must be valid Lisp forms.\n",
    "e.g\n",
    "```lisp\n",
    "(+ 1 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "is  evaluated by first evaluating 1, then 3 and passing the values to the **+** function, which returns 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special Operators\n",
    "- Special operators do things functions can't do. They implement features of the language that require some special processing by the evaluator.\n",
    "- When the first element of a list is a special operator, the rest of the expressions in the list are evaluated according to the rules of that special operator.\n",
    "e.g\n",
    "```lisp\n",
    "(if x (format t \"yes\") (format t \"no\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "The rule for **IF** special operator: first evaluate the first expression. If it's non-**NIL**, evaluate the next expression and return it's value. Otherwise, evaluate the third expression and return it's value. If we don't have a third expression, return **NIL**. General **IF** expression is\n",
    "```lisp\n",
    "(if test-form then-form [ else-form ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another special operator: **QOUTE**.\n",
    "- Takes in a single expression as it's argument and simply returns it unevaluated. e.g,\n",
    "```lisp\n",
    "(qoute (1 2 3))\n",
    "```\n",
    "evaluates to `(1 2 3)` and not `3`. This returned list can be manipulated like any other list in Lisp.\n",
    "- Instead of writing `(quote (1 2 3))`, one can write `'(1 2 3)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Macros\n",
    "- Macros give users a way to extend Lisps syntax.\n",
    "- A Macro is a function that takes in s-expressions as arguments and returns a Lisp form that's then evaluated in place of the macro.\n",
    "- Macro evaluation happen in 2 phases: first, the macro form in passed, unevaluated, to the macro function. Second, the form returned by the macro function, called the macro *expansion*, is evaluated according to normal evaluation rules.\n",
    "- Since the evaluator does not evaluate the elements of the macro form before passing them to the macro function, they don't have to be valid Lisp forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Truth, Falsehood and Equality\n",
    "- The symbol **NIL** is the only false value. Everything else is true.\n",
    "- The symbol **T** is the canonical true value.\n",
    "- **NIL** is both an atom and a list. Also used to represent an empty list. Meaning `()` and `NIL` are completely interchangeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **=** is used to compare numbers for equality.\n",
    "- **CHAR=** is used to compare characters.\n",
    "- **EQ** tests objects for identity. Two objects are **EQ** if they're identical. Object identity of numbers and characters are implementation specific.\n",
    "- **EQL** behaves like **EQ** except that it considers two objects of the same class representing the same numeric or character value to be equivalent.\n",
    "- **EQUAL** and **EQUALP** operate on all types of objects.\n",
    "- **EQUAL** considers lists equivalent if the contain the same structure and contents, recursively. Also considers strings equal if they have the same characters.\n",
    "- **EQUALP** behaves like **EQUAL** except it also considers strings equivalent if they have the same characters differing only in case. Also considers numbers equivalent if they represent the same mathematical value, i.e, `(equalp 1 1.0)` is `T`."
