    "> - The **~a** directive is the _aesthetic_ directive. Consumes a single argument and outputs it in human readable form.\n",
    "> - The **~t** directive is for tabulating. **~10t** means emit enough spaces to move to the tenth column before processing the next directive. Doesn't consume arguments.\n",
    "> - The **~{** implies that the next argument to be consumed must be a list. **format** loops over the list, consuming as many elements of the list as needed each time through the list. The **~}** ends the loop.\n",
